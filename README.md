# CrackerBarrel
Finds solutions to Cracker Barrel's peg game. I was inspired to write this after my friends and I had gone to Cracker Barrel for breakfast after a late night. They were both able to solve the peg game while we were waiting for our food, but I didn't have the patience. My food stole my attention soon afterwards.

Once my belly was full, I figured I would just have my computer solve the game for me. I was just getting into algorithms at the time and thought it would be a useful application of the knowledge I had learned.

The peg game can be seen here: https://www.wikihow.com/Win-the-Peg-Game


### Prerequisites

You need the following python packages:

```
NONE
```

### Installing

Download and run with Python 3.6 or later. Running the script will either print the first solution to the command line, or will save all possible solutions to a CSV file in the same folder as the script (solutions.csv).

## Running

There are two command line arguments: "print" and "save". "save" will save all solutions to a CSV file in the same folder as the script (solutions.csv). "print" will stop the program from printing out the first solution to the game that it finds.
